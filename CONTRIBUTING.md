## Issues

When submitting an issue, please adhere to the following best practices:

1. **Search for existing issues**: Before creating a new issue, search the existing issues to avoid duplicates. If a similar issue exists, contribute to the discussion there instead of opening a new one.
2. **Provide a clear and concise title**: Write a meaningful title that reflects the issue's content. This helps maintainers and contributors quickly grasp the issue's context.
3. **Add a definition of done**: Provide a clear criteria for when the issue is concidered done. This ensures that the implementation lives up to the original intention of the issue.
4. **Include necessary details**: Explain the issue thoroughly, including steps to reproduce (if applicable), expected behavior, and encountered problems. Include relevant screenshots or log files to better illustrate the issue.

## Pull Requests

When creating a pull request, please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth and efficient review process:

1. **Build on the main branch**: We don't want long-lived feature branches. All changes should be integrated into `main` as early as possible.
2. **Write a descriptive title**: Summarize your changes with a clear and informative title, highlighting the purpose of the pull request.
3. **Link to a related issue**: Each pull request should address one and only one issue. Reference the issue number in the description (e.g., `Resolves #123` or `Closes #123`). Trivial hotfixes may be exempt from this rule, but please mention this in the description.
4. **Explain your changes**: Describe the changes you made and the reasoning behind them. Explain how the changes satisfies the definition of done of the addressed issue.
5. **Address review feedback**: Respond to the comments and feedback provided by reviewers. Make any necessary changes and update your pull request accordingly. Resolve any open discussions before merging.
