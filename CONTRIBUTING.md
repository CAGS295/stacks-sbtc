## Reporting Issues

All substantial changes to this repo should be formulated as issues and be visible in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Trust-Machines/core-eng/issues) before being implemented.
An issue should be formulated with enough context to allow any involved developer to implement it.

## Submitting Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request (PR), please follow these guidelines:

1. Link the issue the PR closes. The issue should provide enough context about the problem the PR addresses, so that the PR does not need to rewrite it.

2. Highlight significant implementation details in the description.
3. Test your changes and ensure they don't introduce new issues or break existing functionality.
4. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the pull request.
5. Sign your commits using the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
